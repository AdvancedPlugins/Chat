# How to use: https://chat.advancedplugins.com/customizer

enabled: true

# Replace, update or just modify all existing chat messages from server or plugins!
# These messages have full support of gradients, placeholderapi and more.

# findType is the way to compare and find the message to replace.
# Possibilities are: EQUALS, STARTS_WITH, ENDS_WITH, CONTAINS, REGEX

# E.g. customise the default "unknown command" message. You can fully create your own customizations!
unknownCommand:
  findType: EQUALS # This means `fromMessage` must be exactly the same as the message to replace
  find: '&fUnknown command. Type "/help" for help.'
  replace:
    0: # You can replace multiple parts of the message, this way keeping original message's variables, e.g. special variables. PlaceholderAPI is still supported here!
      from: '&fUnknown command. Type "/help" for help.'
      to: '&cYou''ve typed an unknown command! Type "/help" for help or use "/discord" to join our Discord server!'
